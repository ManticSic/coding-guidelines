# Update Policy

## Fix security vulnerabilities (GCG12001) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
Security vulnerabilities, both self-produced and these that come in through
dependencies, should be fixed as soon as possible.

## Keep your dependencies up to date (GCG12002) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
You should update your dependencies to avoid the situation that you miss
bug fixes or security updates, because the currently used version is no longer
supported or maintained.

It's much easier to update a recent version to the latest than a deprecated
version.

Use [LTS][lts] versions if possible.

## Define a version support policy (GCG12003) <img src="/img/3.png" alt="recommendation level 3" />
If other people (both customers and colleagues) depends on the software it makes
sense to define how long each version will be supported and will receive
updates. You could also define a policy for backward compatibility.

## Maintaining a changelog (GCG12004) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
You should maintain a changelog to make it easier for users and contributors to
see precisely what notable changes have been made between each version of the
project.

Use a VCS to keep track of code changes (see [GCG11001][gcg11001]).

## Software Versioning (GCG12004) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
A clear and documented version schema helps users and contributors to see the
importance of an update. Furthermore, the version can mark releases,
pre-releases, test version etc.
