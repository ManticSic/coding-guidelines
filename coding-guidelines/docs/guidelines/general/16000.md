## Dokumentiere alle von außerhalb verfügbaren Typen und Members (CGC16003) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Documenting all types and members, which are accessible from outside (assembly,
namespace, class, …). Use the common way to document that kind of code,
depending on your programming language (javadoc for java, XMLDoc for .Net and so
on). This way other developers can get the most out of your function without
knowing the concrete implementation.

Furthermore, you can use tools to create professionally looking documentation.

## Write documentation with other in mind (CGC16004) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Write the documentation with other in mind. Assume they will not have access to
the full source, the requirements and specifications, so try to explain how to
get the most of the functionality of your code.

## Avoid inline comments (CGC16005) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
If you feel the need to explain a block of code using a comment, consider
replacing that block with a method with a clear name.

## Don't use comments for tracking work to be done later (CGC16006) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Annotating a block of code or some work to be done using a `TODO` or similar
comment may seem a reasonable way of tracking work-to-be-done. In reality,
nobody really searches for comments like that. Use a project management system
to keep track of leftovers.

Another way is a combination of the usage of a work item in a project management
system, and a related `TODO` comment, with a reference to that work item.

## Only write comments to explain complex algorithms or decisions (CGC16007) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
Try to focus comments on the *why* and *what* of a code block and not the *how*.
Avoid explaining the statements in words, but instead help the reader understand
why you chose a certain solution or algorithm and what you are trying to
achieve. If applicable, also mention that you chose an alternative solution
because you ran into a problem with the obvious solution.
