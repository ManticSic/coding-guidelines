# Naming convention

## Use US English (GCG14001) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
All identifiers (Types, member, parameters, variables etc.) should be named
using words from the US English language.

- Names should be easily readble, preferably grammatically correct names.  
  Example: `HorizontalAlginment` is better than `AlignmentHorizontal`.
- Favor readability over brevity.  
  Example: `CanScrollHorizontally` is better than `CanScrollHorizontally`.
- Avoid using names that conflicts with keywords from widely spread used
  programming languages.

## Use proper notation for language elements (GCG14002) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
Depanding on the used programming language the proper notation for language
elements such as classes, method and variables should be used. Widely spread
casings are [camel case, pascal case, snake case and kebab case][letter-case].


## Don't include numbers in varfianles, parameters and type members (GCG14003) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
In most cases these kind of names are lazy excuses for not defining a clear and
intention-revealing name. Often they are used instead of collections.

## Don't use prefixes (GCG14004) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Types, type members, parameters, variables etc. shouldn't include a prefix to
define the scope or type. Known prefixes are `g_` for `global`, `s_` for
`static` or `string`, `i_` for `integer` and `_` for private members.

In some programming languages it is not possible to obey this rule. Many
languages uses `_` for backing fields, other to communicate that a member is
private.

## Don't use abbreviations (GCG14005) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Abbreviations like `btn` for `button` and `cmd` for `command` harm the
readability and intelligibility. Avoid single character variable names, such as
`i` or `q`. Use `index` or `query`.

**Exception: ** Use well-known acronyms and abbreviations that are widely
accepted or well-known in your work domain. For instance, use acronym `UI`
instead of `UserInterface` and abbreviation `Id` instead of `Identity`.

## Name members, parameters and variables according to their meaning and not their type (GCG14006) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
The name should describe the functionality and not their type.

Identifiers  that refer to a collection type should have plural names.

## Name types using nouns, noun phrases or adjective phrases (GCG14007) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Naming|Example
:--|:---
noun|`IComponent`
noun phrase|`ICustomAttributeProvider`
adjective phrase|`IPersistable`

## Name methods using verbs or verb-object pairs (GCG14008) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Naming|Example
:--|:---
verb|`Show`
verb-object pair|`ShowDialog`

The name should describe the *what*, and if possible, the *why*.

## Name generic type parameters with descriptive names (GCG14009) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Always prefix type parameters with the letter `T` for `Type`.

The name should describe the *what*.

## Name members similarly to other members in the used programming language or framework (GCG14010) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
To let developers, who are already familiar with the used programming
language or framework, finding their way into your project, you should use a
naming pattern which is widely used by the language or framework.

## Avoid short names or names that can be mistaken for other names (GCG14011) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
Although technically correct, statements like the following can be confusing:
```
bool b001 = (lo == l0) ? (I1 == 11) : (lOl != 101);
```

## Don't repeat the name of a class or enumeration in its members (GCG14013) <img src="/img/1.png" alt="recommendation level 1" />
```
class Employee
{
    // Wrong!
    static GetEmployee() {...}
    DeleteEmployee() {...}

    // Right
    static Get() {...}
    Delete() {...}

    // Also correct.
    AddNewJob() {...}
    RegisterForMeeting() {...}
}
```

## Avoid class containing terms like `Utility` and `Helper` (GCG14013) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
Class containing terms like `Utility` or `Helper` are usually static classes and
are introduced without considering object-oriented principles. 

## Avoid method names containing the word `and` (GCG14014) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
A methods containing the word `and` implies, that it is doing more than one
thing, which violates the [Single Responsibility Principle][srp].

## Pr√§fixen von booleschen Variablen und Member (GCG14015) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
## Prefixing of boolean variables and members (GCG14015) <img src="/img/2.png" alt="recommendation level 2" />
To make boolean variables and members more descriptive consider prefixing them
with `Is`, `Has`, `Can`, `Allows` or `Supports`.
